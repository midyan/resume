  description: It is a (still in development) Open-Source project focused on solving mathematical problems using the most wide-spread language of the century - JavaScript. The OCR module is using the Tesseract OCR under the curtains for optical recognition of equations. I will implement Tesseract Training as well. Sometime. </br></br> I intend to create a large enough data-set to train a specific neural network for solving any math problem. Much like Wolfram, but free as a bird. </br></br> If you happen to be a AI Wizard with nothing better to do, come help me. If you are a NodeJS Ninja and wish to change the world or something, come help me. I don't bite. Just email me.

- project: Limitless Google Translate API for NodeJS

  description: Translate large texts using the google-translate-api for NodeJS! The google-translate-api uses query string in a GET method to send the text to be translated to the translation service. This limits the amount a characters you can translate at once at 255 per request. This package chops the texts into smaller, coherent sentences, translates them and mount them back together into the text. This is all done asynchronously, so it won't block your code midway!
